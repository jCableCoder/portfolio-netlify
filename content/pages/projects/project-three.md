For the first Tech Elevator capstone project, I collaborated on on a command-line application developed in Java (IntelliJ) using OOP fundamentals and file.io that displays inventory/stock from a file and accepts user input for depositing money and making a purchase. This vending machine is connected to the user's bank account, and it dispenses tasty treats such as Stackers, Moonpies, Wonka Bars and Mountain Melters.
