This one is a work in progress, but it's a ton of fun! I've already learned about a couple cool built-in JavaScript functions: Math.random(), Math.floor() and Math.round(). Currently, the "Genre" knob is the only one that's working, but I plan to keep adding functionality to this super-fun project!
